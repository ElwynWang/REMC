REMC - Replica Exchange Monte Carlo protein simulation program

Version2.0 --Released by Tong Wang in May 2017   (Version 1.0 was released in 2007)


*** NEW ADDED INPUT FILES ***
<PDB_ID>.frag
<PDB_ID>randomcoil.pdb

Create fragment library file by running LRFragLib. LRFragLib generates two output files, <PDB_ID>.frag and <PDB_ID>.lib. <PDB_ID>.lib records detailed information during computation. <PDB_ID>.frag records dihedral angles and is similar with output file by NNMake in Rosetta. LRFragLib could be downloaded at http://166.111.152.91/Downloads.html

To create <PDB_ID>randomcoil.pdb, run REMC with 500,000 steps with T=1000 and fragmoveweight=0 (line 54 in cfg file). In this simulation, using protein pdb file to replace <PDB_ID>randomcoil.pdb as input. The output of this high temperature simulation is a random coil structure labeled as <PDB_ID>randomcoil.pdb.


*** NEW ADDED MOVE SET ***
fragmove.h

This code file provides the necessary functions and classes to run a fragmove.


*** NEW ADDED PARAMETERS ***
FRAGLIB_FILE (line 10 in cfg): <PDB_ID>.frag
FRAGMOVE (line 54 in cfg): weight of choosing fragmove
NOISE_RANGE_PHI (line 56 in cfg): rotation noise range of phi torsion angles
NOISE_RANGE_PSI (line 57 in cfg): rotation noise range of psi torsion angles


*** NEW ADDED INTERFACES ***
Rewrite the function of "MakeMove" (in move.h) 
Adds some parameters in Backbone.h (line 182-188 and line268-278)


*** NEW ADDED OUTPUTS ***
Add the accepted rates and simulation steps for each move set
